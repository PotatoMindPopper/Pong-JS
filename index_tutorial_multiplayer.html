	  <p>1. Before you can move the paddles, you will need to click within the game canvas.</p>
	  <br></br>
	  <p>2. As for the keys:</p>
	  <p>   For player 1, the left player, you can only use the W-key to go up and the S-key to go down.</p>
	  <p>   For player 2, the right player, you can only use the Up_Arrow-key to go up and the Down_Arrow-key to go down.</p>
	  <br></br>
	  <p>3. As for right now, the game is made that only one key can be registered. This means that only one key will react and therefor you will need to work a bit together.</p>
